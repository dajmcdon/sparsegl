#' Trust in scientific experts during the Covid-19 pandemic
#'
#' A dataset containing a measurement of "trust" in experts along with other
#' metrics collected through the Delphi Group at Carnegie Mellon University
#' U.S. COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey, in partnership with Facebook. This
#' particular dataset is created from one of the public
#' [contingency tables](https://www.cmu.edu/delphi-web/surveys/monthly-rollup/),
#' specifically, the breakdown by state, age, gender, and race/ethnicity published
#' on 05 February 2022.
