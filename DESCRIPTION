Description: Efficient implementation of sparse group lasso with optional
    bound constraints on the coefficients. It supports the use of a sparse
    design matrix as well as returning coefficient estimates in a sparse
    matrix. Furthermore, it correctly calculates the degrees of freedom to
    allow for information criteria rather than cross-validation with very
    large data. Finally, the interface to compiled code avoids unnecessary
    copies and allows for the use of long integers.
