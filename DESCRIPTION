Description: Efficient implementation of sparse group lasso with optional bound 
  constraints on the coefficients. It supports the use of a sparse design matrix 
  as well as 
  returning coefficient estimates in a sparse matrix. Furthermore, it correctly
  calculates the degrees of freedom to allow for information criteria rather
  than cross-validation with very large data. Finally, the interface to 
  compiled code avoids unnecessary copies and allows for the use of
  long integers.
